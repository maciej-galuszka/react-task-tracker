# Task Tracker 📝  
Task Tracker v2 – a modern, minimalistic task management application built with React.

This is the second iteration of the project, fully refactored from vanilla JavaScript into React, introducing enhanced functionality and a more structured codebase. Key features in this version include:

📅 Due Dates: Assign deadlines to tasks for better time management

🔼 Task Priority: Set priorities to organize your workload

↕️ Filtering & Sorting: Quickly find and order tasks based on status, date, or priority

🧹 Clear All Tasks: Remove all tasks at once for a fresh start

The app allows users to create, complete, delete, and organize tasks within a clean and responsive interface. Tasks are persistently stored in localStorage, ensuring data remains even after page reloads.

Built for efficiency and simplicity, Task Tracker v2 helps you stay organized and on top of your daily tasks.
