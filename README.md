# Task Tracker 📝  
A simple, minimalistic task tracker built with **React**.  

This is **version 2** of the project – originally built with vanilla JavaScript, now refactored into React.  
In this version, additional features were added:  
- 📅 due date for tasks  
- 🔼 task priority  
- ↕️ filtering & sorting options  
- 🧹 ability to clear all tasks  

The project allows you to create tasks, mark them as completed, delete them, sort them, and clear all – all in a clean and responsive interface.  
Tasks are stored in **localStorage**, so they stay after you reload the page.
